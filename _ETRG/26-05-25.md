title: "A Characterization for Optimal Bundling of Products with Nonadditive Values"
collection: ETRG
category: papers
permalink: /ET-Reading-Group/26-05-25
extract:  'This paper studies the optimal bundling of products with nonadditive values. Under monotonic preferences and single-peaked profits, I show that a monopolist finds pure bundling optimal if and only if the optimal sales volume for the grand bundle is larger than the optimal sales volume for any smaller bundle. I then detail how my analysis relates to ratio monotonicity results on bundling and describe the implications for nonlinear pricing.'
