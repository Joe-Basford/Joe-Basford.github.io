extract: 'We derive the optimal mechanism for a designer with products at each end of the Hotelling line for sale. Buyers have linear transportation costs and private information about their locations. These are independent draws from a commonly known distribution. Two independent auctions are optimal if and only if two independent auctions are efficient. Otherwise, the problem exhibits countervailing incentives and worst-off types that are endogenous to the allocation rule. Combining a saddle point property with an appropriate ironing procedure allows us to characterize the optimal selling mechanism as a function of a single parameter and to derive associated comparative statics. The optimal mechanism is always ex post inefficient; it involves entering a set of types into a lottery with positive probability. This set and the associated ex post lotteries vary non-trivially with the problem parameters. A two-stage clock auction involving coarse bidding implements the optimal selling mechanism in dominant strategies.'
