excerpt: 'A private-value buyer makes an offer to purchase a good from a supplier with private-cost. Prior to trading and observing cost, the supplier must acquire a license from a monopolist. Licensing is public and payment depends on the subsequent sale’s terms. The monopolist’s optimal contract uses royalties to implement price-maintenance clauses that countervail against buyer-power. Royalties can be negative at higher price levels to allow screening of buyers. They incentivise high-cost suppliers to sell below-cost, motivating high-value buyers to separate from low-value ones by offering higher prices. Welfare effects of such licensing are ambiguous because reversing bargaining power can increase trade.'
