title: "Countervailing Vertical Contracting"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
coauthors: "Daniele Condorelli and Tanay Kasyap"
extract: "We analyse a model in which a privately informed supplier must obtain a publicly observed license from a monopolist before selling to a private-value buyer who holds market power against the supplier. Optimal licensing fees take the form of a royalty schedule that penalises low‐price trades and subsidises high‐price ones. This royalty schedule endows the supplier with commitment power, permitting second-degree price discrimination of the buyer through manipulation of the probability of trade at different prices. Remarkably, the induced trade mechanism coincides with that of a supplier wielding full price-setting power, showing that buyer market power can be entirely countervailed. The welfare consequences are ambiguous: licensing may alleviate the deadweight loss caused by buyer power, but it can also introduce supplier-driven inefficiencies."
