title: "Countervailing Vertical Contracting"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
coauthors: "Daniele Condorelli and Tanay Kasyap"
extract: "We characterise outcomes achievable through observable, irrevocable ex-ante contracts between an upstream firm and a private-cost supplier who subsequently trades with a private-value buyer with price-posting power. Our main result establishes a three-way equivalence: the set of outcomes implementable via ex-ante contracts coincides exactly with those achievable if the supplier could commit to monotone price-acceptance strategies, which in turn coincides with outcomes the supplier could implement by directly designing the downstream trading mechanism subject only to supplier ex-post incentive compatibility and the buyer’s interim incentive and participation constraints.
Strikingly, ex-ante contracting with a single agent can implement ex-post efficient trade with full budget balance, effectively circumventing the standard Myerson–Satterthwaite impossibility. The optimal contract uses negative royalties to make the supplier the local residual claimant on trade surplus, decentralising a d’Aspremont–Gérard–Varet mechanism through observable ex-ante contracting."
