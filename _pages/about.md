Hello! I am Joe, an MRes/PhD student in Economics at the LSE. I'm broadly interested in contract theory and interesting ways of looking at incentives. 

Before starting my MRes/PhD, I received an MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from LSE and a BSc in Economics from the University of Warwick.
